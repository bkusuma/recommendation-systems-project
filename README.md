# Abstract
Work on utltizing a large dataset and breaking down the input with use of sparse matrices and eventually singular value decomposition (SVD) to identify recommendations by: 
1. User-based collaborative filtering
2. Item-based collaborative filtering

# Introduction
The task at hand: 
1. Asks user to enter a personal identification number.

2. Uses a pre-built model to determine the three best items to recommend that person.

3. Uses another pre-built model which was trained on SVD-reduced data to recommend three items to that person.

4. Prints the estimated standard deviation between the original model and the SVD-reduced model (RMSE between two utility matrices).

# Data
These datasets contain attributes about products sold on Amazon which may be sources of bias in recommendations (in particular, attributes about how the products are marketed). Data also includes user/item interactions for recommendation.

<!-- # Methods

Add methods text here. -->

# Results

I was able to wield the data to make a a recommendation matrix.

# Discussion & Next Steps

Still need to create a function to pull out recommendations for a user via an interface.
